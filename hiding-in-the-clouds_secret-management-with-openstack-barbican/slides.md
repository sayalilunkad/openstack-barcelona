# Overview

## Talk contents

* What is Barbican?

* Packages for RDO (RPM Distribution of OpenStack) and SOC SUSE Openstack Cloud available now

* Secret Store Back-ends

* What are all these services about? - barbican-retry, barbican-keystone-listener, barbican-worker

* Use cases: Encrypted cinder volumes, Magnum Cluster certificates, LBaaS

## What is Barbican?

* Getting key material into instances in a secure manner

* Secure Storage for key material (passwords, keys, certificates, arbitrary binary data)

* Provisioning: Interaction with CAs

<!--
Barbican has three main tasks: distributing and storing key material,
and interaction with CAs.

OpenStack instances need various secrets, such as SSL keys, passwords to
authenticate against databases or APIs outside an instance or encryption
keys to access storage volumes. Barbican can get these into an instance
in a secure, auditable manner.

Since instances may be short-lived, it also provides secure, long-term
storage for such secrets. If an instance is rebuilt - as can happen in a
cloud based setup - its secrets can be retrieved from Barbican's secret
storage using a Keystone token.

Last but not least, instances can use Barbican to access certificate
authorities supported by Barbican plugins to submit certificate sign
requests to these CAs through a uniform API.

## More packages available now

* Packages for RDO (RPM Distribution of OpenStack) available

* Packages for SOC (SUSE OpenStack Cloud) available

* Packages for Ubuntu already available

* Puppet modules to install and configure Barbican available

<! --

Puppet modules https://github.com/openstack/puppet-barbican have been
tested against RDO and are currently running in puppet integration tests.

-->

## Secret Store Back-ends

* Operators need to decide how and where secrets are stored.

* Barbican has a plugin infrastructure, configured in barbican.conf

* As of Newton, multiple plugins can be enabled, and can be configured per project.

<!--

Configuring multiple plugins is useful when you need to provide different levels
of security.  Secrets uses by a development or test project could use the basic
development plugin, while some secrets may require a FIPS common criteria
certified storage mechanism using an HSM

-->

## Some Secret Store Plugins

* Development plugin
** Secrets encrypted by symmetric key and stored in Barbican mysql DB
** Encryption key stored in plaintext in barbican.conf
** NOT for production

* PKCS11 plugin
** Secrets encrypted by project specific key encryption keys (KEK) and stored in Barbican mysql DB
** KEKs encrypted by Master KEK, which is stored in HSM using PKCS#11.
** In production with Lunasa, but others possible.

## More Secret Store Plugins

* Dogtag Plugin
** Secrets stored in Dogtag KRA
** KRA is backed by either NSS database or HSM (through PKCS#11)
** Lunasa and Thales netHSM tested, others possible.
** FIPS/ Common Criteria etc.

* KMIP
** Secrets stored in KMIP device

## Barbican Services 101

* barbican-api: interaction with users and instances

* barbican-worker: handles communication with external
  CAs

* barbican-retry: legacy service used for TLS certificate generation

* barbican-keystone-listener: cleans up Barbican resources upon
  Keystone user deletion

<!--

barbican-api is Barbican's main point of contact for the outside world.
Users use it to create secrets, secret containers and
certificates. Instances use it to retrieve their secrets and submit
their certificate sign requests. A note on operations: this should be
run using some sort of WSGI enabled web server. If you install a
package, this won't be a problem SUSE and Ubuntu provide Apache
configuration for running barbican-api using mod_wsgi, while RDO
provides configuration for running it in the gunicorn web server.
The Barbican puppet modules set up Barbican by default over Apache using
mod_wsgi.

barbican-worker is a RabbitMQ driven service that handles communicating
with external CAs for certificate signing requests. It's possible to
have an arbitrary number of workers Synchronization between workers
happens by the consumption of RabbitMQ messages being atomic.

barbican-retry is only used to support TLS certificate generation. It is
scheduled to be removed at some point now. As a rule, you won't need the
retry process for asymmetric and symmetric key generation

barbican-keystone-listener is a cleanup tool that eavesdrops on
Keystone's RabbitMQ queues and cleans up Barbican resources when
projects/users get deleted.

TODO alee: Is this suitable for use? (has been broken throughout Mitaka,
see https://review.openstack.org/#/c/339052/)
